# Power BI - Employee Retention Risk Analysis

The organization was experiencing disproportionately high employee attrition among certain roles and early-tenure employees. The leadership team was aware of the overall attrition rates, but lacked clarity on where the risk was concentrate and the underlying factors contributing to employee turnover. 

The objective of this project is to provide the leadership team with a clear and data driven understanding of attrition patterns across multiple variables. Understanding where attrttion occurs is the first step to understanding why it occurs. With this information, leadership can focus their efforts where improvements will be most impactful. 

The data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggel via a public dataset:

## Slide 1 - Overview & Analysis

<p></p>

The purpose of this slide is to quickly identify where employee retention challenges are most acute. Here, I establish the scope, scale, and distribution of attrition risk by developing KPI's and level-based views.

<p></p>

This slide will assist in answering the following questions established by the leadership team:

<p></p>

*  How severe is the attrition problem overall?
*  Is attrition concentrated early in employee tenure or evenly over time?
*  What job roles and job levels experience the highest attrition rates?
*  Are certain areas of the organization disproportionately affected?

<p></p>

#### Early Tenure Attrition is Primary Risk Area

<p></p>

The organization's overall attriton rate is 16.12%. While not crisis-level, it does indicate a meaningfull level of staff turnover. Deeper investigation reveals a significant concentration of attrition risk among early-tenure employees with nearly 34.88% of employees leaving within their first year. 

<p></p>

#### Attrition Varies Significantly by Job Role

<p></p>

From the visualizations, it is evident that Sales Representatives experience the highest attrition rates, close to 40%. Laboratory Technicians and Human Resource employees also show elevated attriton rates. Managerial and Director-level roles rates are substancially lower, indicating a significant correlation between attrition rate and job role. 

#### Job Level Reveals Structural Risk Differences:

<p></p>

Attrition is highest at Job Level 1 (26.3%). This organization is experiencing a secondary peak at Job Level 3 (14.7%). Job Levels 4 and 5 show noticebly lower attriton rates, suggesting that career progression and seniority provide a stabilizing effect. 

#### Average Tenure Reflects a Mixed Workforce

<p></p>

The average tenure of 6 years suggest a workforce composed of a core group of longer-tenured employees with a rotating population of newer hires.

## Slide 1 - Key Takeaways

<p></p>

We can observe from slide 1 that attrition within the organization is not evenly distributed and that risk is concentrated among:

<p></p>

* Early-tenure employees
* Entry-level roles
* Specific roles including Sales, Lab Techs, and HR employees
