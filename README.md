# Project | Power BI - Employee Attrition Current Overview

### Purpose & Overview

This project presents a descriptive overview of employee attrition patterns using a snapshot of the organization’s current workforce data. The purpose of the analysis is to summarize where attrition is occurring and how observed attrition rates vary across employee groups and demographics, providing a clear current-state view of workforce outcomes.

The dashboard focuses on attrition rates across job roles, job levels, tenure, and satisfaction metrics, and includes distributional views of attrition volume by key demographic attributes such as gender, marital status, and education level.

Together, these visualizations are intended to provide leadership and other stakeholders with a clear, data-driven understanding of observed attrition patterns, highlighting which segments of the workforce experience higher attrition rates and where employee exits are most concentrated. This analysis is designed to support exploratory insight and decision scoping, helping identify areas that may warrant further investigation or targeted follow-up.

The data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggel via a public dataset:

### Analysis

#### Attrition Rates by Job Role and Job Level

Attrition rates vary substancially across job roles and job levels. Sales Representatives experience the highest attrition rate of 40%, with Lab Techs and HR experiencing elevated rates as well. Attrition is highest at Job Level 1 (26.3%). The organization is experiencing a secondary peak at Job Level 3 (14.7%). Job Levels 4 and 5 show noticebly lower attriton rates, suggesting that career progression and seniority provide a stabilizing effect. This suggest that attrition is not evenly distributed across the organizational structure and is more pronounced in specific functions. 

#### Attrition Rate by Tenure 

Attrition is most pronounced during early tenure, with a significant concentration of 34.88% among first year employees. Attrition rates decline as tenure increases, indicating greater retention among longer-tenured employees. The average tenure of 7 years suggest this workforce is composed of longer-tenured employees with a rotating population of newer hires. 


#### Attrition Rates by Satisfaction Levels

Using small multiples, I compares attritiob rates across multiple satisfaction metrics while preserving the scale and interpretability of the visualization. Across all satisfaction dimensions (work-life balance, job satisfaction, job involvement, environmental satisfaction), lower levels are associated with higher observed attrition rates. This suggest that an employees experience is closely related to retention outcomes, most signifacantly regarding work-life balance and job involvement. 

#### Attrition Rates by Years Since Last Promotion 

Attrition rates vary across years since last promotion, with increased rates during certain intervals.

#### Attrition Distribution by Demographics


### Key Takeaways

We can observe from the analysis that attrition within the organization is not evenly distributed and that risk is concentrated among:


* Early-tenure employees
* Entry-level roles
* Specific roles including Sales, Lab Techs, and HR employees


### Recommendations & Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that employee attrition within the organization is not random but instead follows clear patterns across job role, employee experience, workload, and career progression. I suggest the leadership team consider the following:

* Review onboarding processes and role expectations
* Monitor and manage 'overtime status' to lower burnout in high-risk roles
* Use satisfaction metrics to guide proactive retention discussions
* Use time since last promotion as a risk flag
